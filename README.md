#### *model.ipynb*: Jupyter notebook containing the LLM model.
#### *database.py*: Handles interactions with the SQL database.
#### *index.html*: Frontend HTML file for the user interface.

## Usage
1. Use the model.ipynb file to train or test the LLM model.
2. The database.py file is responsible for managing the SQL database.
3. The index.html file provides the frontend for user interaction with the app.
